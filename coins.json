For example, if a user wants to sell ETH for USDT, the pathfinder explores all DEXes (Uniswap, Sushiswap, Curve, Balancer etc) and suggests the most optimum way to split the order across multiple exchanges in a single transaction. \n\nAs a result the user gets the most efficient way to execute a trade. As of April 2021, 1inch provides the most efficient way to trade large amount of tokens in a private and decentralized manner.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native token on 1inch protocol is 1INCH. The token provides governance rights and can be used for decision making on 1inch protocol changes.\n\nThe 1inch network allows the community to vote for specific protocol settings under the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model, in a transparent, user-friendly and efficient way.\n\nUsers who stake their 1INCH tokens, as well as liquidity providers in the 1inch liquidity pools can vote directly on major protocol parameters i.e. the price impact fee, the swap fee, the governance reward, the referral reward, and the decay period.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nThere can be at most 1.5 billion 1INCH tokens. \n\nOn the release day, 6% of the 1INCH token's total issuance of 1.5 billion were unlocked. The remaining tokens are expected to be gradually unlocked over a four-year period through December 30, 2024 in the following manner:  \n\n- community incentives: 30%\n- grants for ecosystem builders: 14.5%\n- backers and core contributors: 55.5%",

            "description": "### Project Description\n\nFormerly known as ETHlend, it was the first DeFi lending protocol when it launched its first main net as ETHlend in 2017.\n\nAave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralised or undercollateralised fashion.\n\nA borrower must lock collateral in crypto that is valued higher than the amount being borrowed. The borrowed amount typically can not exceed 50-75% of collater value. If the USD value of a user’s collateral falls below the necessary collateralization threshold, their funds are posted for liquidation and can be purchased at a discount by other users within the system. \n\nAave was the first to introduce the concept of flash loans. This function lets users borrow large amounts with no collateral but for a fee of 0.3%. This loans are risk free for the Aave platform and have a life span of a fraction of a second. The loan given at the beginning of the transaction and paid back at the end of it. If it has not been paid back, every action user took with that loan is canceled.\n\n### Token Description\n\nAAVE is used to vote and decide on the outcome of Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). \n\nApart from this, AAVE can be staked within the protocol Safety Module to provide security/insurance to the protocol/depositors. Stakers earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol.\n\nThe AAVE token also used to pay for fees when interacting with Aave service. The AAVE collected as fees are then burned making it a deflationary asset. \n\n### Token Emission\n\nThe Aave protocol has a supply cam of 16 million AAVE tokens.\n\nIn 2017, ETHlend ran an ICO where it sold 77% LEND tokens at a price of 1.6 cents. Over 1 billion of its 1.3 billion total supply was sold, raising over 16 million USD. \n\nLater when the project rebranded the tokens were denominated i.e. 100 LEND = 1 AAVE.\n\nAbout 23% of the tokens were kept by the founders and developers of the project.",

The Ampleforth protocol receives exchange-rate information from trusted oracles and propagates that to holders of its units (Amples) by proportionally increasing or decreasing the number of tokens each individual holds.For traders, these changes in exchange-rate and quantity translate into changes in Ample’s market capitalization. Traders with short time horizons, especially those using automated or algorithmic approaches, will thus have to devise new strategies to trade Amples.Ultimately, unique trader behavior in response to the protocol’s incentives is expected to produce a step-function-like movement pattern with lower correlation to Bitcoin than existing digital assets. This makes Amples uniquely suited for the following near, medium, and long term uses.",

The project initially started in early 2018 and launched in March 2020.\n\nWhen swapping tokens on Balancer, it filters through all available pools in the platform (containing requested tokens) and spreads the order to provide the best possible price.\n\nThe Balancer team came up with a powerful mathematical framework that enables token portfolios to continuously self-rebalance while also generating fees.\n\nJust like other decentralized exchanges, Balancer enables liquidity providers earn rewards from trading fees.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native token on Balancer protocol is BAL. The token provides governance rights and can be used for decision making on protocol changes.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nThe total supply of BAL is 100 million tokens:\n\n- 25 million BAL tokens are initially allocated to founders, core developers, advisors and investors, all subject to vesting periods.\n- 5 million allocated to ecosystem fund to foster the protocol.\n- 5 million is a fundraising fund for future funding.\n- 65 million will be distributed to liquidity providers where 7.5 million new BAL tokens expected to enter circulation annually.\n\nThe proposed amount of distributed BALs to liquidity providers is 145,000 per week. In the first year of BAL’s existence there would be 30% supply inflation off the initially allocated supply of 25M tokens. \n\nAt this rate, it would take 8.666 years to distribute the whole 65M BAL remaining until the 100M cap is reached.",

The flexibility of these blockchains allows tokens to be locked in reserve and to issue smart tokens on the Bancor system, enabling anyone to instantly purchase or liquidate the smart token in exchange for any of its reserve tokens.The BNT is the first smart token on the Bancor system and it will hold a single reserve in Ether. Other smart tokens, by using BNT as one of their reserves, connect to the BNT network. The BNT establishes network dynamics where increased demand for any of the network’s smart tokens increases demand for the common BNT, benefiting all other smart tokens holding it in reserve.",

One of the project highlights is that it seeks to offer margin trading in a truly decentralized fashion.\n\nBorrowing can be done through Torque protocol while the Fulcrum protocol handles aspects of lending and margin trading.\n\nThe bZx protocol employs a hybrid order model, where 3'rd party relayers each maintain order books outside blockchain while the actual orders are settled on blockchain.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe BZRX token is a governance token, first and foremost. Collectively, the token holders have the power to upgrade the protocol as they see fit.\n\nThe protocol mandates that relay fees are denominated in BZRX, so it acts primarily as a payment token. \n\nIn the future, there are plans to make the token redeemable for a proportion of the insurance fund to provide a backstop to its value.\n\nFurther, the token will be used to vote on various key parameters such as assets supported by the protoco, the % of interest collected from lenders, the rate of inflation of the BZRX token and more.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nThe 1.03 billion tokens are allocated as follows:\n\n- 50% for token sales\n- 15% to the team\n- 15% to development fund\n- 15% to ecosystem fund\n- 5% to project advisors",

This enables DeFi engineers to build decentralized autonomous services which are able to access liquidity on Compound on demand, without requiring any mediating party or other preconditions.\n\nThe borrowing and lending rates are defined algorithmically based on real-time market dynamics. For instance, when the asset supply increases as more users deposit this asset, it leads to a decrease in borrowing/lending rates.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe COMP token is governance token of the protocol. COMP token-holders can discuss and vote on any future changes to the Compound protocol. For instance, they can initiate proposals to include new assets, or change asset-specific requirements on Compound like required collateralization margins.\n\nIt was explicitly not marketed as an investment, however, it is widely believed token holders will eventually vote in a mechanism of value capture providing them with some claim on the cash flows of the system\n\n### Token Emission\n\nA total of 10 million COMP tokens were created and distributed as follows:\n\n- 4,229,949: users of the protocol (over 4-year period)\n- 2,396,307: shareholders of Compound Labs, Inc.\n- 2,226,037: founders & team (4-year vesting)\n- 372,707: future team members\n- 775,000: for community to advance governance through other means",

Curve employs an Automated Market Maker algorithm and doesn't require any order books. \n\nCurve Finance is possibly the most important protocol in DeFi. Many users of major lending platforms or decentralized exchange aggregators indirectly use Curve without realizing it. \n\nThe Curve protocol was built around stablecoin liquidity in order to provide steadier interest returns to liquidity providers without having to hold volatile assets. For instance, USD/EUR liquidity pools on Curve are significantly more profitable alternatives when compared to savings accounts in traditional banking system.\n\nLike other decentralized exchanges Curve allows liquidity providers to earn a share of trading fees as a reward for providing liquidity. Typically, adding liquidity to pools on Curve generally more profitable than on Uniswap.\n\nWhen liquidity providers deposit stablecoins i.e. USDC or DAI to Curve pools they are awarded with the yTokens for the given pool. When liquidity providers claim deposits back they get entitled to the share of the trading fees accumulated by the pool. So, yTokens are in a way interest bearing tokens.\n\nCurve has a yPool that used for settling trades of the yTokens of liquidity providers. The liquidity provider, or LP tokens of this yPool are called yCRV. \n\nWhen you hold yCRV, you get returns in three distinct ways:\n\n- enhanced yield from owning yTokens.\n\n- trading fees from the yPool\n\n- CRV tokens which distributed to the LPs on Curve\n\nSo, yCRV is an attractive token to hold.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native token on Curve protocol is CRV. The token provides governance rights and can be used for decision making on protocol changes.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nThe total supply of $CRV tokens to be issued is 3.03 billion with an initial supply of around 1.3 billion tokens. The initial supply is expected to be distributed as follows: \n\n- 5% to liquidity providers (1 year vested)\n- 30% to the Curve team and investors\n- 3% to employees (2 year vested)\n- 5% to the community reserve fund\n\nThe remaining 1.73 billion CRV tokens are going to be distributed to liquidity providers on ongoing basis at a rate of 2.25% each year.\n\nThis distribution schedule meant for the first year about 2 million new CRV tokens (~0.067% of the supply) where distributed each day.",

After a combination of different modules, a new product comes out, thereby achieving the effect of 1+1&gt;2. LEGO bricks are the best example and inspiration for those modules. Every brick is plain and ordinary, but it generates endless possibilities when putting together.DEGO equals to LEGO in the DeFi world. Each DeFi protocol as a brick, It could be the stable coin(DAI), flash Loans(Aave, Compound), DEX exchanges(Uniswap and Balancer), derivatives( Synthetix), insurances (Nexus Mutual).

In Holochain, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain.

In return, the stakers receive LON as staking reward.As long as the total LON is within the maximum cap, each buyback triggers LON mint, which is used as rewards in the Tokenlon Incentive Plan.LON is held in the treasury pool governed by the community, used to develop and promote the development of the Tokenlon ecosystem.Tokenlon&#39;s governance is opened in stages with decision-making power gradually handed over to the community.

The borrowed DAI can be freely sent to others, used on exhcnages and DeFi services, or held as long term savings. The ETH collateral released on repayment of the loan and associated service fees.\n\nEvery time the loan is issued by Maker Protocol to someone, a certain amount of DAI gets minted and added to circulating supply. At the same time a collateral in Ether (equivalent to 150% of the DAI loan value) deposited to the Maker Protocol reserves. \n\nWhen the loan is returned and associated service fee are paid, the collateral released back to the borrower. The DAI amount returned by the borrower gets destroyed by the Maker Protocol.\n\nThe Maker Protocol autonomously controls the circulating supply of DAI and ensures the value of the collateral it holds always exceeds the DAI in circulation. \n\nIt also ensures tha price of DAI remains very close or equal to 1 USD at all times through a dynamic system of collateralized debt positions, autonomous feedback mechanisms and incentives for external actors.\n\n### Token Description\n\nMKR is a governance token for MakerDAO which controls the governance aspects of the Maker Protocol.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nMKR launched with 1,000,000 MKR tokens and has distributed them to early adopters and through three private sales.\n\nThe MakerDAO also acts as a buyer of last resort if for some reason the cumulative value of the collateral in the protocol falls below the value of DAI in circulation. Should that happen the Maker Protocol mints new MKR tokens and sells them on the open market for DAI which subsequently gets destroyed to account for the gap.\n\nAt the same time, borrowers taking DAI loans from Maker Protocol require MKR tokens for some aspects of the service. Maker Protocol destroys these tokens and by doing so puts an upward pressure on MKR token price.",

Once created, they can be traded freely via a network of relayers and will be priced according to supply and demand. The Opium Network is a learning ecosystem that can work with the custom logic of both derivatives and oracles. All created positions are represented by ERC-721o tokens that are specially designed for trading financial instruments and can be combined into portfolios and natively traded in combined orders. At the same time, these tokens are backward compatible with the ERC-721 token standard and can be used in existing ecosystems. ",

Rewards for liquidity provision will initially be distributed in PERL, BAL and UMA tokens.PerlinX also leverages the UMA protocol to generate synthetic assets. Each asset will have its own price feed, which is powered by UMA&#39;s Data Verification Mechanism (DVM), a decentralized oracle that&#39;s designed to solve the problem of centralized and corruptible oracle price feeds. All synthetic assets on PerlinX will have the prefix px (eg. pxGold, pxCarbon, etc).

Perlin is focused on helping to create more efficient, equitable, and open marketplaces and economies that can benefit everyone everywhere. As the first ever project in the world to enable synth asset minting based on UMA Protocol – we’re now one step closer in the grand vision.PERL can be used as both a liquidity and collateral asset.

For instance, sBTC is a synthetic Bitcoin synth asset that can be bought and sold on Synthetix exchange at a current Bitcoin price.\n\nSynths can potentially track the price of any asset and enable crypto-natives and unbanked users to trade on Synthetix Exchange without liquidity limitations. \n\nThe traders always trade against the exchange which buys synth asset from the user (i.e. sUSD) and gives him/her another synth asset (i.e. sBTC) taking into account current market prices of both assets. During the exchange, Synthetix destroys the asset it received from user and creates a synth asset that's passed to the user.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native token in the Synthetix protocol is known as Synthetix Network Token and has a ticker SNX. It's the governance token as well as the main collateral currency in the SNX ecosystem. \n\nThe synthetic assets are created by Synthetix protocol and are backed by native network tokens (SNX) locked into a smart contract as a collateral. \n\nThe SNX token holders are incentivized to stake their SNX tokens and receive sUSD tokens in exchange which are stablecoins pegged to USD.\n\nSNX stakers incur debt when they mint Synths, and to exit the system (i.e. unlock their SNX) they must pay back the debt which may go up/down depending on the pool of synths in the ecosystem.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nOn March 2018, a 100 million of SNX tokens were issued and allocated as follows:\n\n- investors: 60%\n- bounties and marketing: 3%\n- partnerships: 5%\n- foundation: 12% (vested quarterly for 12 months)\n- team and advisors: 20% (vested quarterly for 24 months)\n\nA new monetary policy was introduced in 2019 which introduced an inflationary supply to reward active stakers. \n\nEach year, for 5 years, the total rewards would be halved, starting at 75,000,000 SNX for the first year. The total supply will eventually reach 245,312,500 SNX by 2024.\n\nIn December 2019, the schedule changed to smooth out the decrease and add inflation into perpetuity.",

It's aims to bring speed and low transaction costs to decentralized finance. It was launched by the Serum Foundation, a consortium of partners including FTX, Alameda Research, and the Solana Foundation. \n\nUnlike AMM-based decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Serum provides full limit order books with an interface familiar to that of centralized exchanges.\n\n### Token Description\n\nSerum introduces two new tokens: a discount and staking token with limited governance capabilities called Serum (SRM) and a similar second token that allows for even steeper trading discounts dubbed MegaSerum (MSRM). One MSRM is equal to 1 million SRM.\n\nSRM is Serum’s governance token that is primarily an SPL token (Solana's token standard) but is cross-listed as ERC20 on Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nThere is a maximim supply of 10 billion SRM tokens. \n\n- 10% of those are unlocked from start with a large portion of those meant as incentives for service users.\n- remaining 90% are to be released linearly over a 6 year period between 2022 and 2027.\n- All seed sales were locked.\n\nSerum uses 80% of the revenue generated by the exchange to buy back and burn SRM tokens every week. \n\nThe remaining 20% gets distributed to SRM stakers that have locked their holding in Serum's staking contract.",

Once the funds are verified by the trust company, their API will instruct the TrueUSD smart contract to issue tokens on a 1 to 1 ratio and to send them to the Ethereum address associated with the account at hand.Once in the wallet, the tokens can be transferred to a friend or used as payment, combining the advantages of fiat (stability and trust) with those of cryptocurrencies (reduced fees and transfer times).

Whereas other DeFi protocols rely upon minting new tokens to sustain their staking and farming rewards, YFDAI has allocated tokens for these products which will be replenished with fees generated by the ecosystem. YFDAI also has a deflationary burn mechanism built into the platform that will ultimately reduce the total supply to just 13,950 tokens. YFDAI’s mission is to clean up the DeFi space by de-risking the purchase of new projects by performing due diligence vetting and requiring adherence to the same protocols that YFDAI itself adhered to on their launch. YFDAI’s motto is ‘no more exit scams or rug pulls.’",

After suffering an exploit in February, 2020 Andre stepped away from the project. He later returned and re-branded project to yEarn.finance introducing a suite of new tools.\n\nToday yearn.finance offers several instruments for those looking to earn passive income on their assets in a fully decentralized manner.\n\nThe most prominent product in its ecosystem is Vaults which maximize users' return on staked assets through various strategies proposed by the community. \n\nThen there is Earn service, where users' staked funds are continuously shifted between various lending/borrowing protocols (dYdX, AAVE, and Compound) to ensure they are obtaining the highest interest rates at all times among the platforms specified above.\n\n### Token Description\n\nYFI is a governance token and its holders are eligible to receive a portion of protocol profits which are generated through above mentioned services. \n\nThe protocol profits are accumulated in Yearn Treasury Vault. The treasury needs a buffer of $500,000 and if the buffer reaches its ceiling, the collected fees get distributed to YFI stakers in the governance pool. \n\nYFI token holders can submit and vote on proposals to govern the system. Proposals that meet quorum requirements and generate majority support are implemented by a 9 member multi-signature wallet. The multi-signers are also voted in by YFI holders. \n\n### Token Emission\n\nThe supply for YFI tokens is capped at 36,666.\n\nYFI was launched with 0 supply with no pre-mine for the team or early investors. Instead, the 30,000 tokens were distributed equally to users of the platform and liquidity providers through various mechanism i.e. providing liquidity to yPool on Curve and providing liquidity on Balancer's YFI pool.\n\nThe ability to mint new tokens lies with special addresses extended to 9 multi-sig owners requiring 6 signatures. These members are active members in the DeFi community and Andre did not include himself as a signatory.",

He is the CEO of IOHK, the company that built Cardano’s blockchain.\n\nCardano is one of the biggest blockchains to successfully use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is less energy intensive than the proof-of-work algorithm relied upon by Bitcoin. \n\nIt's an Ethereum like smart-contract enabled blockchain that allows for arbitrary services to be built on top of it. Cardano is significantly faster than Ethereum and therefore capable of processing a lot more transactions at a very low cost.\n\nThat said, desp Cardano is still nowhere near Ethereum when it comes to the number of services operating on the blockchain and the value locked in smart contracts. \n\nThe project has taken pride in ensuring that all of the technology developed goes through a process of peer-reviewed research.\n\n### Token Description\n\nTha native cryptocurrency unit of Cardano blockchain is ADA. The token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Those who hold it have a right to vote on any proposed changes to the software powering Cardano blockchain.\n\nAs is the case with other proof-of-stake blockchains ADA token holders can stake their tokens and earn ADA tokens as a result.\n\nThere are two ways an ada holder can earn rewards: by delegating their stake to a stake pool run by someone else, or running their own stake pool. \n\nThe more stake is delegated to a stake pool (up to a certain point), the more likely it is to make the next block – and the rewards are shared between everyone who delegated their stake to that stake pool.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nAbout 30 billion of those are already in circulation. As part of initial fund raising there were 5 rounds of public sales of Cardano tokens, held between September 2015 and January 2017.\n\nApproximately 2.5 billion ADA was allotted to IOHK once the network launched. Meanwhile, an additional 2.1 billion ADA was given to Emurgo, a global blockchain technology company that served as a founding entity of the Cardano protocol. \n\nAnother 648 million ADA was given to the not-for-profit Cardano Foundation, which aims to promote the platform and increase levels of adoption.\n\nOverall, about 16% of ADA’s total supply went to the project’s founders, with the remaining 84% being split among investors.\n\nThere can be a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA tokens. The newly issued tokens are distributed among ADA token holders which stake their tokens with the protocol.",

Tendermint Core’s BFT consensus algorithm is well suited for scaling public proof-of-stake blockchains.The first zone on Cosmos is called the Cosmos Hub. The Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset proof-of-stake cryptocurrency with a simple governance mechanism which enables the network to adapt and upgrade. In addition, the Cosmos Hub can be extended by connecting other zones. The hub and zones of the Cosmos network communicate with each other via an inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, a kind of virtual UDP or TCP for blockchains. Tokens can be transferred from one zone to another securely and quickly without the need for exchange liquidity between zones. Instead, all inter-zone token transfers go through the Cosmos Hub, which keeps track of the total amount of tokens held by each zone. The hub isolates each zone from the failure of other zones. Because anyone can connect a new zone to the Cosmos Hub, zones allow for future-compatibility with new blockchain innovations.

BNB is a cryptocurrency created in June 2017, launched during an ICO in July, and initially issued as an ERC-20 token. Designed to be used for a fee reduction on the Binance exchange, its scope was extended over the years.BNB powers the Binance Chain as its native chain token. For instance, it is used to pay fees on the Binance DEX, issue new tokens, send/cancel orders, and transfer assets.BNB is also powering the Binance Smart Chain, which is an EVM-compatible network, forked from “go-ethereum”. It supports smart contracts and relies on a new consensus mechanism: Proof-of-Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus (“Parlia”), which incorporates elements from both Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority. BNB is used for delegated staking on the authority validator, leading to staking rewards for users and validators.Besides its on-chain functions, BNB has multiple additional use-cases such as fee discounts on multiple exchanges (e.g., Binance.com), payment asset on third-party services, and participation rights &amp; transacting currency on Binance Launchpad.At the core of the economics of BNB, there is a burn mechanism leading to period reductions in its total supply (~ every three months). From its initial maximum supply of 200 million, burns are expected to continue until the supply reaches 100 million.Whitepaper",

There are no order books. \n\nPancakeSwap is a clone of SushiSwap and has an almost identical codebase but has the advantage of cheaper and faster transactions due to being built on BSC. Typically fees for executing trading transactions are ranging from $0.04 to $0.20, and transactions take less than 5 seconds on average.\n\nAside from cheaper network fees, PancakeSwap offers a lower swap fee of 0.2% while the sector average is typically 0.3%.\n\nOn the back of its low-fee model, PancakeSwap became one of the industry's largest decentralized exchanges by trading volume and total value locked (TVL) in February 2021, standing toe-to-toe with AMM model pioneer Uniswap.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native cryptocurrency token on PancakeSwap exchange is CAKE and give its holders a right to propose and vote on changes to PancakeSwap mechanics. \n\nUsers are also able to stake CAKE in the pools of PancakeSwap and earn more CAKE tokens, or even tokens of other projects built on the Binance Smart Chain such as DODO, UST (Terra USD), or LINA (Linear Finance).\n\n### Token Emission\n\nThere's currently no hard cap on the supply of CAKE token, making it an inflationary token. \n\nThe CAKE token's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. That's how the CAKE token created.\n\nDaily emission (based on 30k blocks per day) is 1.2 million CAKE, but with 450,000 per day burned the effective daily emission is 750,000 CAKE per day.\n\n- Farmers: 450,000 CAKE\n- CAKE holders: 300,000 CAKE\n\nThere are some deflationary measures in place which consistently destroy CAKE tokens. All burn processes are currently manual.\n\n- 9.09% of CAKE harvested from farms are burned\n- 10% of CAKE spent on lottery tickets are burned\n- 100% of CAKE raised in IFOs are burned\n\nThere is no supply cap for CAKE. PancakeSwap team is planning transition to a community-led emissions model, where governance vote will be held at the end of each month to decide how emissions are to be adjusted for the following month.",

Public blockchains like Bitcoin have no means to know anything that happens outside its blockchain network. \n\nFor instance, using Polkadot a decentralized financial service on Ethereum blockchain can track the status of the transaction on Bitcoin blockchain and act accordingly.\n\nPolkadot also allows anyone to build special purpose blockchains known as parachains that can communicate with other blockchains connected to Polkadot blockchain. That creates a network of special purpose blockchains that not only able to communicate with each other but also get to benefit from the security model of Polkadot blockchain.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native cryptocurrency unit on Polkadot network is DOT. Polkadot token holders have complete control over the Polkadot protocol, including managing exceptional events such as protocol upgrades and fixes.\n\nThe token gets further utility value from the way transactions from parachains are being validated and recorded on the main Polkadot blockchain. The entities validating transactions on parachains and then brodcasting them to the main Polkadot blockchain are required to lock DOT tokens as a safety measure against cheating. \n\nGood validators are rewarded for this by Polkadot protocol in a form of newly issues DOT tokens whilst bad ones lose their deposit stake.\n\nUsers with DOT tokens can choose to stake their tokens with one of the enitites validating transactions and earn part of the rewards received by validator.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nThe Polkadot Foundation concluded an ICO in October 2017 and raised over $140 million by selling 50% of the 10,000,000 DOT token supply. \n\nLater, DOT token holders conducted governance vote to redenominate DOT tokens by a factor of 100, increasing the total supply to 1,000,000,000. \n\nThe rate of issuance of new DOT tokens by the protocol is dependent on the current staking rate in the network and maxes out at 10% as the staking ratio approaches 50%. The more DOT staked the higher is the inflation rate.",

Luna, as the native staking asset from which the family of Terra stablecoins derives their stability, utility, and value, acts both as collateral for the entire Terra economy and as a staking token that secures the PoS network. Luna can be held and traded like a normal crypto asset, but can also be staked to accrue rewards in the network generated from transaction fees. Luna can also be used to make and vote on governance proposals.The family of Terra stablecoins is designed to achieve stability through consistent mining rewards with a contracting and expanding money supply. For example, if the system has detected that the price of a Terra currency has deviated from its peg, it applies pressure to normalize the price. Currently, the family of Terra stablecoins includes: KRT (Terra stablecoin pegged to Korean Won), UST (Terra stablecoin pegged to US Dollar), MNT (Terra stablecoin pegged to Mongolian Togrog), SDR (Terra stablecoin pegged to IMF SDR), with more being added in the future.",

The same thing cannot be said about wBTC (wrapped Bitcoin) which requires users to trust the entity behind wBTC coins which rperesents a point of failure. Swapping BTC to renBTC and back is faster than alternative technology known as atomic swaps.\n\nIt should further be noted that Ren converts external assets (ex: BTC) to an Ethereum ERC20 type token (ex: renBTC) giving the underlying asset all properties of ERC20 token standard.\n\nThe engine that powers decentralized interoperability solution of Ren is called RenVM, which is a network of network nodes (Darknodes) making up a virtual machine. RenVM is a sort of rustless custodian for cryptocurrency – every renBTC token issues by Ren is backed by an equivalent BTC token stored in the RenVM.\n\nThe RenVM network is also trustless, meaning there is no central authority that can stop you minting or redeeming tokens.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native cryptocurrency token on Ren protocol is REN. The token is required for running a node on the RenVM network. 100,000 REN tokens are required to register and run a Darknode. \n\nAlthough, the REN token has no other use case than for operating a node, people are encouraged to run Darknodes as they can earn fees in more popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. \n\n### Token Emission\n\nThe Ren token, called REN has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. It is an ERC20 compliant token sold during the token sale. \n\nDuring the two rounds of ICO, 60.2% of the tokens were sold to investors. Ren conducted a presale and public token sale in 2018, during which a total of 60.2% of the supply was sold to investors.\n\nIt has a reserve fund of 19.9% of the total supply with 9.9% of the fund allocated internally to advisors, the team, and its founders.\n\nThe team tokens came with a two-year lock-up period, with a six-month lock-up for advisor allocations.\n\nAlso, 10% of the REN supply is specifically for partnerships, development, and other activities.",

The project opted to distribute tokens through a few tokens sales, a reward mechanism for providing liquidity, and direct allocations to early contributors:\n\n- Nodes & liquidity incentives: ~220.5 million RUNE. Two-thirds of this goes to service nodes (aka validators), and the remaining third to liquidity incentives.\n- THORChain company: 65 million (vested over 40 months).\n- Community reserves (RUNEVault): 60 million, emitted over 2.5 years. RUNEVault issues 2 million RUNE each month as part of its staking rewards program.\n- Team & Advisors: 50 million, locked until mainnet launch, then released in 20% batches every 3 montns.\n- Seed investors: 30 million, of which 4 million were distributed immediately. Locked until mainnet launch, then released in 20% batches every 3 months.\n- Private Sale investors: 70 million. 50% of this pool was unlocked upon distribution to provide enough liquidity on Binance DEX. The other half unlocked one week after the close of THORChain's initial DEX offering (IDO).\n- Initial DEX Offering (IDO): 7 million, no vesting schedule.",

Moreover, it can achieve such a high throughput without the need to delegate operations to other attached blockchains known as sidechains (layer 2) as is the case with blockchains like Polkadot or Ethereum 2.0. \n\nSolana is developed by a company of the same name which is based in San Diego, California. The team consists of former Qualcomm, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Dropbox employees.\n\n### Token Description\n\nSOL is a cryptocurrency native to the Solana blockchain. It is used to pay for executing transactions on the Solana network. \n\nSOL holders can also stake their tokens to become a blockchain node and receive earn some additional SOL tokens as a result.\n\nThe governance of the Solana blockchain is also expected to be oversee by SOL token holders.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nSolana has had 5 funding rounds in total and raised over 25 million USD in funding across these five rounds. \n\nSOL cryptocurrency has a total supply of 500 million and about 185 million SOL tokens were sold during the funding rounds.\n\nOf this total supply:\n\n- 36.2% sold to private investors\n- 12.8% allocated to the team (vested over 2 years)\n- 10.4%  allocated to the Solana Foundation\n- 39% allocated to the Solana community\n\nAs part of Solana's security design, all network fees which are paid in SOL are burnt, reducing the total supply.",

Today the project maintained by a non-profit TRON Foundation.\n\nTRON often compared to Ethereum due to many similarities projects share. Like Ethereum TRON enables developers to create autonomous financial and other services powered by smart contracts. Although the platform enables free and considerably faster transactions, it's nowhere near the Ethereum when it comes to the amount of value locked in the services operating on top of the blockchain. \n\nOn 25 July 2018, the TRON Foundation announced it had acquired Bittorrent, the biggest peer-to-peer file sharing network. Later the Bittorent ecosystem got its own token  on TRON platform.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native unit of currency in TRON blockchain network is TRONix, denoted by a symbol TRX. While transactions are nearly free the still require a tiny bit of TRX tokens as a measure against spam attacks. \n\nTRX token holders may stake their holdings with the protocol and earn passive income. The more users stake, the more TRON Power (TP) they earn. Then TP tokens can be used for voting on Super Representatives on the blockchain which are tasked with producing blocks. \n\n### Token Emission\n\nIn 2017 TRON Foundation conducted initial coin offering (ICO) and raised about $70 million for further development of the TRON blockchain and ecosystem around it. There was an initial issuance of 100 billion TRX tokens.\n\nInitially, TRON blockchain used to award 32 TRX tokens to one of the Super Representatives powering the network with every new block, roughly every 3 seconds. At the same time, 16 TRX were awarded to one of the witness nodes (or Super Representative Candidate). As a result, the approximated daily inflation is 1.38 million TRX and the approximated yearly inflation is over 500 million TRX.\n\nLater, community voted to change this incetive mechanism. Rewards for each block were lowered from 32TRX to 16TRX, while the amount of voting rewards increased tenfold to 160TRX which gets split between top 127 SRs, proportionally to the number of votes they received.",

In the same manner, users may redeem Tether tokens into fiat currency by selling them on crypto exchanges or via Tether's website.\n\n### Token Description\n\nTether stablecoin tokens are denoted by USDT symbol and exist on several blockchains \n\nBeing a cryptocurrency token on a blockchain, Tether adopts some benefits of cryptocurrency allowing parties to transact with each other pseudo anonymously.\n\nAny individual accepting Tether tokens as payment may potentially do so without knowing the identity of the sender. The sender only needs a wallet that supports sending and receiving of Tether tokens.\n\nTether stablecoin can be found on most cryptocurrency exchages, both centralized and decentralized, and supported by most crypto wallets. It's a highly liquid stablecoin and usually traded in pairs with the highest daily trading volume.\n\nTether is a centralized stablecoin and can potentially be compared to cash in your bank account. Tether funds on your cryptocurrency wallet can potentially be frozen and confiscated, as such functionality is integarted into a smart contract powering Tether stablecoin.\n\nTether is available on many blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, etc.) \n\n### Token Emission\n\nThere is no limit to supply, and as of April 2020 there is more than 50 billion tokens in circulation.\n\nThe basic operating principle behind any centralized stablecoin like Tether is that there should be an equivalent amount of USD held by the company issuing the stablecoin.\n\nThis deposit ensures that the Tether Limited can always act as a buyer of last resort to purchase all Tethers in circulation should every Tether token holder decide to sell it.\n\nThe Tether Limited currently acts as a centralized custodian of the reserve assets. The company claims that all Tether tokens in circulation are 100% backed by cash and other liquid assets.\n\nAt this point there is no sure way to know that Tether Limited has the required amount of cash or other liquid reserves. There has been some controversy around that. Thus, the reliability of Tether tokens is fully dependent on the amount of trust someone is willing to place into the Tether Limited as a company as well as the external factors that may affect its ability to operate.\n\nThat said, Tether Limited currently offers one of the most convenient ways to purchase large amount of cryptocurrency for someone outside western hemisphere.",

So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was later changed to Monero.\n\nLike some top cryptocurrency projects Monero has a growing community of supporters voluntarily working on various parts of the ecosystem.\n\nMonero also has a block size cap of 2 MBs, but it’s a soft cap. When the line of waiting transactions gets too long, the miners can increase the size of the blocks.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native unit of currency in Monero network denoted by a symbol XMR. A single XMR token consists of 1,000,000,000,000 piconero units.\n\nThe main utility value of monero lies in ability to execute fully anonymous transactions which are for the most part impossible with most of the other cryptocurrencies.\n\nToday it's often labelled as the privacy coin of choice when it comes to transacting on the dark web.\n\n### Token Emission\n\nThere are about 18 million XMR tokens in circulation. Similar to many proof of work cryptocurrencies i.e. Bitcoin, new Monero tokens are awarded to one of the network nodes on every block (every 2 minutes)\n\nThe current emission amount is about 1.2 XMR and will gradually drop until end of May 2022. At this point, rewards will be fixed at 0.6 XMR per block.",

It facilitates formal verification, a technique that mathematically proves the correctness of the code governing transactions and boosts the security of the most sensitive or financially weighted smart contracts.Tezos takes a fundamentally different approach to governance by creating governance rules for stakeholders to approve of protocol upgrades that are then automatically deployed on the network. When a developer proposes a protocol upgrade, they can attach an invoice to be paid out to their address upon approval and inclusion of their upgrade. This approach provides a strong incentive for participation in the Tezos core development and further decentralizes the maintenance of the network. It compensates developers with tokens that have immediate value rather than forcing them to seek corporate sponsorships, foundation salaries, or work for Internet fame alone.Blockchain data provided by: Blockchair (main source), TzStats (backup)",

            "description": "### Project Description\n\nXRP Ledger is an open-source, permissionless, peer-to-peer payment network that allows fast transactions. It was designed to challenge existing financial system, eliminate high fees, reduce processing times and address liquidity challenges faced by financial institutions when using traditional payment channels (i.e. SWIFT, ACH, FedWire etc). \n\nToday, the development of XRP Ledger is driven primarily by Ripple, a privately owned company. The company funded through their own reserves of XRP as well as by private investments from Andressen Horowitz, Google Ventures and others. \n\nWhen compared to other projects in the crypto ecosystem the XRP Ledger is relatively less decentralized because of Ripple’s heavy involvement as one of the driving forces of adoption. It is also important to note that approximately 21% of the validator nodes on the network are controlled by Ripple company.\n\nThe XRP Ledger is integrated with a number of commercial non-open (permissioned) services from Ripple like RippleNet, a permissioned payment network comprised of over 300 institutions (banks, payment providers, brokers, unions) that serve as independent users and transaction validators on the network.\n\n### Token Description\n\nXRP is the native digital currency supported by XRP Ledger. XRP is measured precisely to the nearest 0.000001 XRP, called a drop.\n\nEvery transaction on the Ripple network requires a tiny commison fee of 10 drops (.00001 XRP) which gets destroyed. \n\nAlso, a minimum balance of 20 XRP is required to be held in each wallet address\n\n### Token Emission\n\nAt inception, 100 billion XRP tokens were created and fixed to be the maximum supply cap. The 80 billion XRP were allocated in the form of a grant to Ripple company.\n\nAccording to Ripple company, approximately 50 billion XRP is currently being held in escrow with a max. of 1 billion XRP released on a monthly basis for sale to fund its activities. It is important to note that several reports from independent data providers have surfaced that discuss some discrepancies with how XRP supply is disseminated.\n\nThe majority of XRP supply is still held by the Ripple founders and the company. Though there are selling restrictions placed on both, there is a risk of pressure on the price of XRP.",

Users can exchange two tokens at great speeds in a deentralized manner.\n\nWhat makes it standout from other AMM based decentralized exchanges is that Radium is tightly integrated with Serum decentralized exchange and connects all of its liquidity pools to the orderflow of Serum exchange. In other words, Raydium provides liquidity to Serum's limit order book, meaning that Raydium's users and liquidity pools have access to the order flow and liquidity of the entire Serum ecosystem, and vice versa. \n\nAmong other things, Raydium gives users the option to view trade charts and set limit orders.\n\n### Token Description\n\nThe native cryptocurrency token of Raydium is RAY. \n\nUsers may stake RAY tokens and earn a percentage of transaction fees originating from trades. Traders that make transactions on the platform pay a fee, which is then redistributed to liquidity providers and stakers.\n\nOne other way through which users can earn RAY tokens is by depositing their funds to farming pools. \n\n### Token Emission\n\nThere is a hard cap of 555 million of RAY tokens.\n\n- Team : 20% (locked 1-3 years)\n\n- Advisors : 2% (locked 1-3 years)\n\n- Partnerships : 2%\n\n- Mining : 34% (over 36 months)\n\n- Liquidity Reserve : 8% \n\n- Community and Seed : 6%  (locked 1-3 years)",
